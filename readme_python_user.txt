If you want to get the code to edit it, or use it with your own python with a .bat file, you can get both of them in _settings.
It requires a python 3.12 install.
The .bat creates and manage a virtual env, so you don't need to worry about the packages.

The files are intended to work from the same level as the .exe, so you need to get them back here.
